            <p>Censorship is increasingly becoming a global issue and has affected not just authoritarian regimes but also democracies. Countries are starting to implement stricter controls over online speech and content. To safeguard internet freedom, it is essential for tech companies, governments, and individuals to advocate for digital rights and actively push back against censorship.</p>

            <p>Many big tech companies operate within a profit-driven framework. Their primary goal is often to maximize shareholder value. If addressing censorship or advocating for free speech doesn’t align with their financial interests (such as potential loss of revenue in regions with strict censorship) they may opt to remain passive. This could mean avoiding controversial stances that might impact their business operations negatively. In essence, the pursuit of profit can overshadow ethical considerations, leading to inaction on critical issues like censorship.</p>
            
            <p>Internet censorship is not as insurmountable as it may seem; it can often be bypassed with the right tools and resources, especially with support from Silicon Valley. These companies have the power to address these issues, and it is their responsibility to ensure that users can access these platforms without risking their privacy or leaking data through unsafe networks or applications used to circumvent censorship. This can lead to fewer DDoS attacks, less malware, and similar benefits.</p>

            <p>As you can see, I am already logged in using IPs from Iran, Russia, and China. Some countries block access to these platforms through IP-based blocking rather than deep packet inspection. Nevertheless, I managed to bypass these restrictions without using a VPN or proxy, simply by circumventing firewalls and similar measures.</p>

            <p>While bypassing censorship can be straightforward, maintaining that access can be challenging without support from big tech companies.</p>

            <p>Countries like Russia have relatively easier censorship to navigate, at least based on my simple tests and research; however, I haven’t conducted long-term studies in those countries. Iran’s firewall is particularly severe, as it prioritizes control over network quality. Their aim is not just to restrict access to platforms but to frustrate users, making them feel powerless while pushing them toward domestic alternatives, all while profiting in the process. This leads to financial corruption, as they sell VPNs and domestic servers that claim to bypass restrictions. They manipulate network configurations to allow data packets to evade the firewall, add safe IP ranges for easier access, and create keywords that include domains to help packets avoid detection. These practices are just the tip of the iceberg.</p>

            <center><strong>The era of censorship is behind us, yet it feels like no one is paying attention anymore!</strong></center>

            <p>For the past couple of years, I have been focused on bypassing firewalls and deep packet inspection. In the last two years, I've concentrated exclusively on testing within Iranian networks to help people access the internet. I’ve devoted most of my days to this work, using my own savings and without any external support (nobody seems to care!). Despite these challenges, I have successfully enabled others to access an uncensored internet.</p>

            <p>However, most of the tools and methods I’ve tested and developed can eventually be detected. I try my best to discreetly share some of these methods, making them temporary solutions that aren't suitable for the long run. I’ve even managed to bypass some basic tunneling protocols (such as PPTP, L2TP, GRE, IPIP, OpenVPN, and WireGuard), which are already blocked by simple firewall rules.</p>

            <h2>IP Spoofing</h2>

            <p>Unfortunately, as scary and impossible as it may seem, it isn't.I spent nearly $2,000 on spoof servers, even falling for scams while searching for a reliable option. I reached out to multiple companies, including Tier 1 ISPs and data centers, hoping to gain access for testing and creating video examples. Sadly, none of them responded. Only a few companies, most notably the Svenskar, politely declined.</p>
            
            <p>Finding a suitable server for IP spoofing with legitimate reasons is challenging. The servers I'm testing and using are vulnerable, but I haven't been granted authorized access for spoofing. I've limited my requests to avoid drawing attention that could lead to my server being banned or result in fines for the data center. Additionally, not all internet IP ranges are available; only a select few can be accessed depending on the server.</p>

            <p>However, if any legitimate company could provide me access to their servers with spoofing capabilities, I could conduct further research and create video examples.</p>

            <p>These are just basic examples to spark your imagination. There are various methods you can develop to bypass censorship using IP spoofing.</p>

            <p>I don't remember much about the satellite, and I'm not sure if services like one-way satellites are still available. However, as I recall from nearly 20 years ago, it was mostly based on MAC addresses, like a switch.</p>

            <p>You don't need a server for spoofing because I used it back then to gain unauthorized access to the satellite. You can buy it, or they may offer services for free. However, you might need some relay servers.</p>

            <p>Creating a mesh network with Starlink as the uplink and other one-way satellites as downlinks for thousands of users is an excellent solution for total internet shutdowns.</p>

            <h2>Let’s explore some suggestions and test domain fronting.</h2>

            <p>Believe me, these methods can be highly effective when executed correctly, especially with support from tech companies. They may remain effective until everyone has satellite internet on their phones.</p>

            <p>The approach of companies collaborating to make detection and censorship more challenging is generally effective. For instance, if a CDN provider allows domain fronting for certain blocked sites like (Meta, Telegram, and YouTube) it can enable rerouting of traffic to the original CDN requests. By leveraging millions of IP addresses and domains, it becomes increasingly difficult for governments to block all of them effectively.</p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Foreigner Domain Fronting :</strong></li>
                <p>For this example, we can try using domain fronting with a simple site like someshop1.com hosted on Cloudflare. Then, we can attempt to use a custom header or host header to reroute traffic to a site like telegram.org, which has its own data center. However, all of its IP addresses and domains are blocked, making direct access and domain fronting impossible. This situation highlights how beneficial it would be if these entities cooperated with each other.</p>
                <li><strong>Local Domain Fronting :</strong></li>
                <p> A site like YouTube is filtered in Iran. However, we can easily access it through other domains on platforms like Google using domain fronting. Similarly, a site like Discord hosted on Cloudflare is also filtered in Iran. We can access it through domain fronting if the CDN allows us to use this method for certain sites, even if we use our own domain. At the very least, this approach can be helpful.</p>
                <p>curl --resolve www.google.com:443:142.250.179.206 https://www.google.com/watch?v=jNQXAC9IVRw --header "Host: www.youtube.com"</p>

                    </video>
                </div>
                <li><strong>IP Blocked and Non-Cooperation with Others :</strong></li>
                <p> Some sites can be accessed using a single IP address. However, if they could modify all domains for other requests to be the same and reroute through custom header values instead of relying on multiple domains, it could help bypass restrictions. This could be achieved by creating our own domain with a custom host header and SNI on a CDN like Fastly or Gcore, or by using Cloudflare Workers to connect to the blocked platforms.</p>
                <li><strong>Bypass IP Blocked with CDN :</strong></li>
                <p>Your company can help bypass IP blocking by routing requests through its network. The original site can then respond directly to the client using the same IP address that connected to the CDN, or by using a different range of IPs as a mask back to the client. This method minimizes overload on the CDN and reduces costs for the original sites using the CDN provider. This approach is similar to IP spoofing.</p>
                <li><strong>Fake SNI :</strong></li>
                <p> Using Fake SNI can sometimes be beneficial for sites that permit them. However, this is not a permanent solution and may only be effective for certain sites.</p>
                <p>curl --resolve speedtest.net:443:142.250.179.206 https://speedtest.net/watch?v=jNQXAC9IVRw --header "Host: www.youtube.com" -k</p>

            <p>For domain fronting to work effectively and securely, it’s ideal for browsers to support both domain fronting and custom IPs based on the domain. I attempted to create one but was only successful with HTTP using a simple site. HTTPS does not allow changes to the host header in browsers for security reasons. I am trying to use Nginx as a reverse proxy, which loads some content, and using Tamper Chrome has been helpful. However, creating a browser from scratch to support this is beyond my current knowledge. In theory, it should be possible.</p>

            <p>my recommendation is using domain fronting or custome domain through a simple extension created by the same company for security. If the browser allows it, or if there’s a custom app for each site individually, like YouTube, this could further simplify the process. Essentially, we would be changing the IP and domain ourselves.</p>

                </video>
                <p>An example of domain fronting is accessing Instagram using the Threads domain without any tampering.</p>
            </div>

            <p>A browser within a browser may not be the best option, but it can be very effective for students and employees.</p>

            <div class="media">
                <video controls>

            </div>

            <center><a href="browser-within-a-browser.html">Here are some resources you can use.</a></center>


            <h2>Final considerations</h2>
            <p>The best possible method involves using real domains or fake domains for fronting (I still can’t figure out how we can create this to remain undetectable), along with simple forwarding from internet exchanges connected to countries with blocking. This approach can effectively help bypass restrictions.</p>

            <p>For example, in Iran, we have a direct connection to Delta-Telecom as an upstream provider. Now, platforms that are blocked, VPN providers, or any kind of service can contact these companies to establish a contract for IP forwarding. This would enable the rerouting of traffic to the correct origin.</p>

            <p>What I mean is that if I want to access tor bridge and the IP is blocked in my country, I can use any IP that BGP routes see as the best option and prefer it to the upstream provider with whom the site has a contract. For example, in Iran, we use one of the IP ranges associated with the upstream network, Delta-Telecom.</p>

            <p>When packets are received from Iran at Delta-Telecom, the destination address can be modified to the correct origin IP based on the user's source IP.</p>

            <p>If we want to simplify this process, we can think of it as a large IP forwarding operation at the upstream level, where traffic is routed based on the source IP to the correct destination, like tor bridge. Now, tor bridge can send data back to us using IP spoofing.</p>

            <p>It may sound easy, but when it comes to upstream companies, it’s quite complex. However, this approach can provide a significant advantage, making it difficult to detect or block.</p>

            <h2>Farewell</h2>
            <p>These are some of my tests and experiments from the past couple of years, along with a few suggestions. Due to mental, physical, and financial reasons, I can no longer pursue this path. However, I hope others will carry on the work I began.</p>
